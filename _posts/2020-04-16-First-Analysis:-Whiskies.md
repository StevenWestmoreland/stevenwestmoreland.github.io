## About the Data Source
The dataset being explored here is from https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/database/. It covers the Cost, Country, Type, and Class of an assortment of whiskies as well as the Cluster and Super Cluster of thier flavor profiles. It also includes the normalized Meta Critic score (as defined at https://whiskyanalysis.com/index.php/methodology-introduction/methodology-metacritic-score-construction/), the Standard Deviation of the normalized score, and the number of reviews that contributed to that score.
